/*The most challenging algorithmic problems involve optimization, where we seek to find a solution that maximizes or minimizes an objective function. Traveling salesman is a classic optimization problem, where we seek the tour visiting all vertices of a graph at minimum total cost.  it is easy to propose TSP “algorithms” that generate reasonable-looking solutions but do not always produce the minimum cost tour.
Algorithms for optimization problems require proof that they always return the best possible solution. Greedy algorithms that make the best local decision at each step are typically efficient, but usually do not guarantee global optimal- ity. Exhaustive search algorithms that try all possibilities and select the best always produce the optimum result, but usually at a prohibitive cost in terms of time complexity.
Dynamic programming combines the best of both worlds. It gives us a way to design custom algorithms that systematically search all possibilities (thus guar- anteeing correctness) while storing intermediate results to avoid recomputing (thus providing efficiency).*/
